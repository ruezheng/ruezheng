### Hi, I'm Rue! ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated and analytical Back-End Engineer who loves **puzzles**, **technical challenges**, and **learning new technologies**. 

I genuinely enjoy the process of **writing**, **optimizing**, and **debugging code**, especially in a **collaborative environment**. Coming from a background in accounting, Linux system administration, and community organizing for non-profits, my experiences became a passion for creating efficient solutions to problems through software development. 

Curious and self-motivated, I seek to apply my experiences and grow with a company that creates purpose-driven software.
